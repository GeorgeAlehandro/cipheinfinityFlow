# Infinity Flow: High-throughput single-cell quantification of 100s of proteins using conventional flow cytometry and machine learning

This repository contains the software package ***infinityFlow*** designed to analyze massively-parallel cytometry experiments, such as BioLegend's *LEGENDScreen* or's BD *Cell surface screening panels*. 

You can learn more about the Infinity Flow approach using the following sources. If you use this software in your research, please cite **Infinity Flow: High-throughput single-cell quantification of 100s of proteins using conventional flow cytometry and machine learning, Becht, Tolstrup, Dutertre, Ginhoux, Newell, Gottardo and Headley, 2020**.

The package is available from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/infinityFlow/). Alternatively, you can install it from github:

```
if(!require(devtools)){
	install.packages("devtools")
}
if(!require(infinityFlow)){
	library(devtools)
	install_github("ebecht/infinityFlow")
}
```

To use the package, you can follow the [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/infinityFlow/inst/doc/basic_usage.html). Alternatively, you can run the following command in an R session after installing the package:

```
browseVignettes("infinityFlow")
```
